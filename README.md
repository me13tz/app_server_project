####app_server_project
Mini project using imported modules in Python. Got the idea from a [Udemy](www.udemy.com) class. 

Using load_balancer as the main file, this project is to simulate an environment in which user requests are spread evenly among a series of available app servers. The fake_database is just an old algorithm (Russian Peasant) that multiplies two numbers together, simulating the users accessing a database to obtain data. The computer1, computer2, etc. files are the app servers which fulfill the users' requests by serving up said data. Then, I limit the number of requests to the last five, which might be a "Top Five" or "Last Five" list of requests that could be displayed on a web site in a 'ticker' fashion. Although it would never work in a real-world situation, it's cool exercise in using Python modules and function calls to express the idea.
